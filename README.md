## Mandelbrot visualiser

This is a simple implementation of the Normal Julia sets which also supports coloring, panning and zooming

This is simply adapting [this code](https://github.com/sherif-gamal/mandelbrot) to draw Julia sets instead of the Mandelbrot set. You can find detailed walkthrough on my personal blog [The Mandelbrot set](https://sgamal.com/blog/mandelbrot-1) and [Julia sets](https://sgamal.com/blog/julia-sets).
